### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software quality manager working for [ICTU](https://www.ictu.nl) in The Hague, The Netherlands. ICTU helps the Dutch government develop digital services for its citizens. Often, our projects require the development of custom software. My responsibilities include supporting our custom software development projects with processes and tools that help us develop high quality software. 

ICTU's software development approach is documented in the [Kwaliteitsaanpak](https://github.com/ICTU/Kwaliteitsaanpak) (sorry, in Dutch only). To be able to measure and monitor our quality, we have developed an open source automated quality system, called [Quality-time](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time).
