### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software quality manager working for [ICTU](https://www.ictu.nl) in The Hague, The Netherlands. ICTU helps the Dutch government develop digital services for its citizens. My responsibilities include supporting our software development and maintenance projects with processes and tools that help us develop high quality software together with our colleagues at other Dutch governmental organizations. 

ICTU's software development approach is documented in the [Kwaliteitsaanpak](https://github.com/ICTU/Kwaliteitsaanpak) (sorry, in Dutch only). To be able to measure and monitor our quality, we have developed an open source automated quality system, called [Quality-time](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time).
